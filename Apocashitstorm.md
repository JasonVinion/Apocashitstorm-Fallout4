**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 0 (October 23, 2077)**

What a day, what a horrible day. Morning was normal, just me, Nora, Shaun, and Codsworth hanging around. Then everything went to hell. Cosworth yells out about bombs hitting New York and Washington. Damn lucky that Vault-Tec guy came earlier, got us a spot in Vault 111 because of my army days and Nora being a lawyer.

When the alarm hit, we bolted. Had to leave Codsworth, though. The vault folks rushed us into these pods, saying they were for decontamination, but no, they were freezing us! I couldn’t do anything when they shot Nora and took Shaun. Then everything went black.

Woke up later, found out it was all some sick experiment. The vault’s a mess, everyone’s gone or dead. Had to fight off these giant roaches with just a baton. Must’ve killed a bunch of them before I found the exit.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 1 (October 23, 2287)**

Out of the vault, and the world’s gone gray and dead. Felt like something was off, so I took a detour, then heard some folks. Tried to be friendly, but they shot at me. Had to take them down, their dog too. Felt awful, like, were these my neighbors?

Looted their camp for whatever could help, found some crummy armor. Got jumped again, but handled it. Then back home, and there’s Codsworth, acting like it’s just another day. He tells me it’s been 210 years. Can you believe that?

We checked out the old neighborhood, fighting bugs and taking what we could. Left with Codsworth, but then met this dog at a gas station. Named him Dogmeat. He’s a good boy. We’re sticking together.

Night’s coming, so we’re heading to Concord under the cover of dark. Can’t believe this is my life now.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 2 (October 24, 2287)**

The night was a hell of a lot more eventful than I hoped. Staying in the Red Rocket station where I met Dogmeat turned into a battlefield. Got jumped by massive mole rats and some of the biggest rats I’ve ever seen. Managed to beat down the mole rats with my trusty baton from the vault, but those rats forced me to waste some precious ammo.

Heading into Concord this morning, Dogmeat and I kept it quiet, even managed to sneak past a raider scout armed with just a pool cue. Then heard this massive firefight happening not too far off. Someone was yelling for help. My old instincts took over, and I ran towards the chaos.

Found a guy on a balcony, holding off raiders with a laser weapon like I’ve never seen. Looked like a cross between a musket and a high-tech science project. He was in a bad spot, with about five or six raiders trying to storm his position. With him firing from above and me coming in from behind, we caught the raiders off guard and took them out fast. The guy then tossed me a laser musket like his and told me he was trapped with a few others. Needed my help, so I charged in.

The place was a mess, looked like some old museum. There was this Advanced-locked gate and a big mural, and a crashed Vertibird was hanging through the roof. Inside, two raiders were shooting down at me from a balcony, but they couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn, made it easy to take them out with my training.

Sneaking through the museum, I found a fusion core behind an easy-to-pick lock. Still had some juice in it—might fetch some caps later. Looted what I could—ammo, scrap, the usual survival stuff.

Finally found the room where the others were holed up. The group was a mixed bag. Preston Garvey, the guy from the balcony, was their leader, a real straight shooter. Then there was Mama Murphy, an old lady with more spirit than most and some sort of sight into the future—sounds crazy, but these days, who knows? There were a few more: Sturges, a handy guy with tools; Marcy and Jun Long, a couple still shaken by everything that’s happened.

We decided to hunker down in the museum for the night. Made camp amid the relics of the old world, trying to make sense of this new one. Tomorrow, we'll see about moving out. But for tonight, at least, we’ve got a roof and walls.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 3 (October 25, 2287)**

Started the day with a quick lesson from Sturges on picking advanced locks and patching up weapons—skills that'll sure come in handy. But before I could put that new know-how to real use, the raiders decided they weren’t done with us. Bullets started punching through the walls again.

We had one shot to push back, thanks to the vertibird crash on the roof. The old T-45 power armor up there and a minigun still attached needed a fusion core—which I had from yesterday. Suited up, feeling the weight and power of that armor, I ripped the minigun off and got ready to rain hell.

While up there, I found a holotape in a toolbox. It was from Staff Sergeant Michael Daly, a guy I knew briefly from my service days. Daly's log was grim: his vertibird went down on the day the bombs fell, crew casualties followed, and the surviving members either got shot by panicking survivors or abandoned the site. His armor ran out of juice, and with no reason to stick around, he decided to check on his sister in Boston, questioning if "AWOL" even meant anything anymore. That gave me a pause—how many more were out there, wandering alone?

Anyway, decked out in Daly's armor, I laid into the raiders. But as I was collecting ammo off the dead, this monster—like some sort of demon lizard on two legs—burst from the ground. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen, tearing through what was left of the raiders. I unloaded the minigun into it until I had to duck into a building, while it took off in the other direction. Can't say if it died, but it sure wasn’t sticking around to chat.

Low on ammo and with the power armor's core nearly spent, I had to ditch the heavy gear. Gathered what I could from the raider corpses, snagged a sawed-off shotgun among the loot. Met back up with the gang, and we decided it was time to move. We’re heading to Sanctuary, where I used to live. Hopefully, we can set up something stable there. It’s been one hell of a day, but at least we’re still breathing.
