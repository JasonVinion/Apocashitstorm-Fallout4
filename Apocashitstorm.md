**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 0 (October 23, 2077)**

What a day, what a horrible day. Morning was normal, just me, Nora, Shaun, and Codsworth hanging around. Then everything went to hell. Cosworth yells out about bombs hitting New York and Washington. Damn lucky that Vault-Tec guy came earlier, got us a spot in Vault 111 because of my army days and Nora being a lawyer.

When the alarm hit, we bolted. Had to leave Codsworth, though. The vault folks rushed us into these pods, saying they were for decontamination, but no, they were freezing us! I couldn’t do anything when they shot Nora and took Shaun. Then everything went black.

Woke up later, found out it was all some sick experiment. The vault’s a mess, everyone’s gone or dead. Had to fight off these giant roaches with just a baton. Must’ve killed a bunch of them before I found the exit.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 1 (October 23, 2287)**

Out of the vault, and the world’s gone gray and dead. Felt like something was off, so I took a detour, then heard some folks. Tried to be friendly, but they shot at me. Had to take them down, their dog too. Felt awful, like, were these my neighbors?

Looted their camp for whatever could help, found some crummy armor. Got jumped again, but handled it. Then back home, and there’s Codsworth, acting like it’s just another day. He tells me it’s been 210 years. Can you believe that?

We checked out the old neighborhood, fighting bugs and taking what we could. Left with Codsworth, but then met this dog at a gas station. Named him Dogmeat. He’s a good boy. We’re sticking together.

Night’s coming, so we’re heading to Concord under the cover of dark. Can’t believe this is my life now.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 2 (October 24, 2287)**

The night was a hell of a lot more eventful than I hoped. Staying in the Red Rocket station where I met Dogmeat turned into a battlefield. Got jumped by massive mole rats and some of the biggest rats I’ve ever seen. Managed to beat down the mole rats with my trusty baton from the vault, but those rats forced me to waste some precious ammo.

Heading into Concord this morning, Dogmeat and I kept it quiet, even managed to sneak past a raider scout armed with just a pool cue. Then heard this massive firefight happening not too far off. Someone was yelling for help. My old instincts took over, and I ran towards the chaos.

Found a guy on a balcony, holding off raiders with a laser weapon like I’ve never seen. Looked like a cross between a musket and a high-tech science project. He was in a bad spot, with about five or six raiders trying to storm his position. With him firing from above and me coming in from behind, we caught the raiders off guard and took them out fast. The guy then tossed me a laser musket like his and told me he was trapped with a few others. Needed my help, so I charged in.

The place was a mess, looked like some old museum. There was this Advanced-locked gate and a big mural, and a crashed Vertibird was hanging through the roof. Inside, two raiders were shooting down at me from a balcony, but they couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn, made it easy to take them out with my training.

Sneaking through the museum, I found a fusion core behind an easy-to-pick lock. Still had some juice in it—might fetch some caps later. Looted what I could—ammo, scrap, the usual survival stuff.

Finally found the room where the others were holed up. The group was a mixed bag. Preston Garvey, the guy from the balcony, was their leader, a real straight shooter. Then there was Mama Murphy, an old lady with more spirit than most and some sort of sight into the future—sounds crazy, but these days, who knows? There were a few more: Sturges, a handy guy with tools; Marcy and Jun Long, a couple still shaken by everything that’s happened.

We decided to hunker down in the museum for the night. Made camp amid the relics of the old world, trying to make sense of this new one. Tomorrow, we'll see about moving out. But for tonight, at least, we’ve got a roof and walls.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 3 (October 25, 2287)**

Started the day with a quick lesson from Sturges on picking advanced locks and patching up weapons—skills that'll sure come in handy. But before I could put that new know-how to real use, the raiders decided they weren’t done with us. Bullets started punching through the walls again.

We had one shot to push back, thanks to the vertibird crash on the roof. The old T-45 power armor up there and a minigun still attached needed a fusion core—which I had from yesterday. Suited up, feeling the weight and power of that armor, I ripped the minigun off and got ready to rain hell.

While up there, I found a holotape in a toolbox. It was from Staff Sergeant Michael Daly, a guy I knew briefly from my service days. Daly's log was grim: his vertibird went down on the day the bombs fell, crew casualties followed, and the surviving members either got shot by panicking survivors or abandoned the site. His armor ran out of juice, and with no reason to stick around, he decided to check on his sister in Boston, questioning if "AWOL" even meant anything anymore. That gave me a pause—how many more were out there, wandering alone?

Anyway, decked out in Daly's armor, I laid into the raiders. But as I was collecting ammo off the dead, this monster—like some sort of demon lizard on two legs—burst from the ground. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen, tearing through what was left of the raiders. I unloaded the minigun into it until I had to duck into a building, while it took off in the other direction. Can't say if it died, but it sure wasn’t sticking around to chat.

Low on ammo and with the power armor's core nearly spent, I had to ditch the heavy gear. Gathered what I could from the raider corpses, snagged a sawed-off shotgun among the loot. Met back up with the gang, and we decided it was time to move. We’re heading to Sanctuary, where I used to live. Hopefully, we can set up something stable there. It’s been one hell of a day, but at least we’re still breathing.

![Museum|400x400][unitedpenguin1043_A_poorly_drawn_hand-drawn_sketch_of_a_Museum__8d743cde-c7ff-4e68-93fd-8c287ddaac04.png]

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 4 (October 26, 2287)**

Today was heavy, found an old tape in a run-down cabin, belonged to a girl who ran away the night before the bombs fell. Told her folks she was pregnant, they freaked out—her dad yelling, her mom just crying. She couldn't turn to the baby's father, just took refuge in that old cabin. Found a skeleton next to it, probably hers. Sad to think she might have come here for shelter only to meet the end.

Then there's Preston, saying we need to rebuild, get the Minutemen back on their feet. Wants me to help people out here; couldn't say no. But damn, down to 29 bullets in my 10mm, and after today, I'm worrying how long I can keep this up.

Stumbled upon Abernathy farm, a place literally built around a radio tower. Met Blake Abernathy, said raiders killed one of his daughters, Mary, and took her locket. His family, including his wife Connie, grows mostly tatos. They've got a cat named Maisie and a two-headed cow, or Brahmin as they call it, named Clarabell. This farm is like a slice of old-world normal in the middle of chaos.

Saw my first Radstag too, or so I think there called, it's like a deer but a nastier, two-headed version. Found a Minuteman stash but no luck opening it. Then there was this old house, a skeleton in the bathtub—creepy spot with drugs scattered everywhere. 

Got ambushed in the forest outside of Sanctuary. Thankfully, a scavenger distracted them long enough for me to take cover and handle the situation. Decided I need both Dogmeat and Codsworth with me. I don't like traveling in a pack of three, especially not with one being a robot. Were very loud and its hard to hide, but I need Cosworth to watch me and dogmeat's back. 

These raiders are relentless. Blake thinks they're holed up at USAF base Olivia. Preston hears of another group terrorizing a settlement. I'm caught between needing to fight and wanting to avoid it. But if I'm to listen to Preston and head to this so called 'Diamond City' to chase leads that he thinks will help me find Shaun, I can’t have raiders on my trail.

Thinking of hitting the USAF base first. It’s a military setup, so I should be familiar with the layout. They're targeting small outfits like Abernathy’s, so maybe they're not as strong as they seem. I need to gear up, though. Despite being ready physically, mentally, it's a whole other story. War was supposed to be behind me, not part of rebuilding a life.

Tomorrow’s about prepping. If I can quiet down these raider threats, maybe, just maybe, I can make it to Diamond City without another target on my back. But, damn, this isn’t the life I signed up for—not again.

![Abernathy farm|400x400][unitedpenguin1043_A_hand-drawn_sketch_of_a_post-apocalyptic_far_7debbccd-e82f-47ba-b02a-691490754654.png]

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 5 (October 27, 2287)**

Morning found me poking around the Wicked Shipping Fleet Lockup. It’s eerie how quickly places fall apart these days. Stumbled upon a bunch of corpses—only these weren't your usual dead. Codsworth calls them Feral Ghouls; pretty much zombies if you ask me. Had a close call with one that latched onto my leg, but I put it down fast. Managed to get a Protectron functioning and set it to handle the ghouls while I explored.

Found a holotape left behind by someone named Tim Flynn, warning his brother Blake about a shady deal gone sour with a guy named Eddie. Talk about family drama turning potentially lethal. He was desperate to shut down their business and skip town, scared of the consequences.

Heading back to Concord, I got ambushed by a group shouting "for the gunners," which I guess is their gang name. They were tough, well-armed, and trained, but not smart enough to avoid a choke point. Codsworth torched them with his flamethrower while I used the cabin for cover. Looted a full set of Combat armor off them; felt familiar and reassuring, like slipping into an old habit.

Inside the cabin, I found a root cellar turned into a sort of makeshift bunker with supplies and a weapon workbench. The real surprise was the ghoul inside—turned out to be Wayne Gorski, a radical libertarian who thought the government was out to control minds with new electrical pylons. Found his terminal detailing plans to blow up the "mind control device" with a homemade bomb from mini nuke parts and nuclear waste. Talk about going out with a bang. Thankfully, his plan never took off—world ended before his did.

Decided to spend the night in that cabin. It’s quiet, and after today, quiet’s good. Seems every corner of this wasteland hides someone’s broken dream or a nightmare waiting to jump out. But this armor feels right, gives me a bit of the old days back. Tomorrow's another day to push forward, hopefully with a little less unexpected company.

![Ghoul|400x400][unitedpenguin1043_pocketbook_drawing_if_a_zombie_667f8523-6798-45af-a5ea-fc09b063756d.png]!

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 6 (October 28, 2287)**

Today, I headed back to Concord to cover some ground I missed earlier. It started off grim enough with a fire still burning and two dead bodies next to it. No time to ponder that scene, as I heard noise from a nearby house on the ridge. Suddenly, these robot-like creatures, a blend of machine and something eerily human, came storming out. They were armed with these weird, modified blue laser pistols.

Taking cover, I opened fire. These things, synths they're called, soaked up bullets like sponges. It took a ridiculous amount of lead to bring them down—arms, then legs, and finally a shot to the head did it. Found something called a 'synth component' inside their skulls, which is where I got there name from. Each ship came with with a serial number, wonder how many of these things there are. Those things pack a punch; was lucky to have a stimpack to patch myself up.

Inside the house, I found a dead junkie, looked like he tried to fight but didn’t stand much chance. Took the chems off him and moved on. Found a letter nearby titled 'The Day the Bombs Fell'—a suicide note from Concord's mayor talking about his family. This world’s just full of sad stories.

Next was the Concord speakeasy. The place was a mess, full of overdose victims and scattered chems like X-cell and Day Tripper. There was this one room with a skeleton in a bathtub, surrounded by mannequins posed with machetes and a plunger. Creepy doesn’t even start to cover it. Rushed out of there when I encountered two feral ghoul kids. Broke my heart, but had to put them down.

Made my way to the Concord Workhouse after that. Mostly empty, but found a skeleton clutching a duffle bag on the third floor, a baby rattle lying next to it—a small, haunting reminder of normal life. Just as I was about to leave, a group of Gunners barged in. Big shootout ensued. They had numbers, but I had the high ground. Nearly took a bullet to the head, but my combat armor's helmet saved me. Managed to escape without a scratch.

Concord’s giving me more than I bargained for—ghosts of the past and very real dangers of the present. Keeps you on your toes, this place. But with each day, each fight, I'm finding bits and pieces of what it takes to survive here. Just got to keep moving, stay sharp.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 7 (October 29, 2287)**

This morning set out feeling solid with this new armor—like I could take on whatever this wasteland throws at me. On the way to check out a farm Preston mentioned, I decided to swing by the USAF Satellite Station Olivia first.

Came across a quarry on the route but noticed someone lingering around, so I gave it a wide berth for now—another place to circle back to later.

Reaching USAF Olivia, I almost got an explosive welcome thanks to a landmine strapped to a molerat. It detonated a bit too close for comfort, but nothing a little shaking off couldn't fix. The outside was eerily quiet, the raiders apparently wiped out by a molerat invasion. Made my job easier taking out the stragglers and scavenging what I could from the bodies.

Inside, it was clear these raiders weren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. Decked out in shoddy leather armor, they went down with minimal fuss. There was talk of their leader, Ack-Ack, but no sign of them. Guess they took some folks and hit the road. The place was undermanned, a couple of raiders downstairs, one upstairs. I took the quiet route with the one upstairs, using my knife—it was messy, and it's doing a number on me, seeing all that blood. Downstairs, a small skirmish was all it took to clear the area. Found the locket that belonged to the Abernathy's daughter—I hope returning it gives them some peace and wards off any future raider trouble.

Stumbled upon a crashed vertibird too, with a full set of power armor nearby, tagged with Gunner graffiti. No fusion core, but it’s a find I'll haul back to Sanctuary Hills later.

Made it up to Tenpines Bluff, the spot Preston mentioned. It’s a small setup, just two folks there, but they’re willing to join the Minutemen if I help fend off some raiders. Problem is, those raiders are a bit of a trek away. I’m worried the farm might not hold till I can deal with that threat. Also found a derailed train on my path, but no loot worth mentioning.

Ended up scoring a rusty, wooden pipe revolver with about 100 rounds. Not the prettiest or the best, but it’s reliable enough to be my new go-to weapon.

Wrapped up the day at a local farmer's place who was kind enough to let me bunk for the night. Despite the day's grim tasks, it's these small kindnesses that keep the hope alive. Tomorrow's another day on this trail—hopefully, one that leads to less blood and more bonds.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 8 (October 30, 2287)**

Day broke with the farmer handing me a stimpack and some radaway. Kindness like that is rare out here. Her dog was a friendly one too, a bit of cheer in the grim reality.

On my way, spotted some makeshift windmills atop an old highway—turned out to be a pretty fortified base. Noticed the Gunners' symbol, that skull with an X. They had a turret, nearly got me as I was initially in its blind spot. Managed to duck just in time, saving my skin.

Approaching the base, I saw a raid party of about ten heading out, leaving it lightly guarded. Perfect timing. Codsworth, Dogmeat, and I stormed in. With most of their force gone, those left didn’t stand a chance—it was over quick. Sadly, meant the best loot was probably out with the patrol. Found some chems and a real sturdy piece of custom armor, even better than pre-war stuff. Grabbed what I could and got out fast before the patrol could return. Didn’t want to stick around for that confrontation.

Came across a downed plane later, "Skylines Flight 1981" painted on the side. Looked like an EMP from the bombs brought it down. It was getting dark, so didn’t stick around to loot—might head back there later.

Picked up that power armor I found yesterday near the crashed vertibird. Good thing too, because on my way back, two massive crab-like creatures burst from the water. No time to fight that battle, especially wanting to conserve ammo, so I booked it in the armor.

Heard gunshots and yelling not too far off, rushed to check it out while still in the armor. Found a guy at a camp with a crossbow. He tried a tricky move, pretending to be friendly then attacked. Power armor came through, stopped his melee cold. Had to take him down after that—turned out he wanted the armor for himself.

It’s getting late, and after today’s escapades, it’s time to head back to Sanctuary. Got a feeling things are just heating up around here, but at least I'm heading back better armed and armored. This world, it keeps you on your toes, always expecting the unexpected.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 9 (October 31, 2287)**

Made it back to Sanctuary to some encouraging news. Preston updated me that the Abernathys have joined the Minutemen. We're slowly turning Sanctuary into something resembling a livable place again, setting up basic necessities like beds, water, and food. Given the increased Gunner activity after my recent outpost raid, I beefed up security at the old Red Rocket station. It's got a solid metal door and I've sealed off other entries, making it a tough nut to crack.

Sure enough, a Gunner patrol showed up looking to scavenge. Despite my warnings, they opened fire, so I had to take cover and defend the place. Once the dust settled, I looted their gear and headed down the road, where I met Trashcan Carla. Traded some junk for her ammo and radaway—a good deal.

Further down, I stumbled upon the Drumlin Diner, where a standoff was unfolding. Wolfgang, a chem dealer, was arguing with Trudy, the diner owner, because her son Patrick hadn't paid for some Jet he bought. I tried to mediate, but things escalated. I sided with Trudy—wasn't about to support a drug pusher. After the shootout, Trudy was grateful and offered to trade with me. The place had a post-war vibe, didn't recognize it from before.

My journey took me to Lexington, a place that's too quiet for comfort. Checked out a parking garage first—few ghouls, no loot. Then I found the Super Duper Mart. Looks promising, but I'll have to come back when I have more time.

In downtown Lexington, the streets crawled with ghouls, and raiders occupied the rooftops. One raider was decked out in power armor, wielding a Fat Man—a portable nuke launcher, absurdly powerful and dangerous. I steered far clear of that madness.

Ended up discovering a bizarre scene at an old bank: the vault blasted open from the inside, a skeleton sprawled among heaps of pre-War money, another half out of a destroyed car, a failed escape attempt.

An eyebot attacked some ghouls and then mistook me for a threat, so I had to take it down. Worried about drawing more attention, I decided to retreat to the parking garage to camp out for the night. Better to lay low until daylight. This world's relentless, but these small victories and steady progress in rebuilding the Minutemen give me a sliver of hope. Tomorrow's another day to fortify, explore, and survive.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 10 (November 1, 2287)**

Today was intense, even by wasteland standards. Started off in the Lexington apartments, full of traps—a landmine and a tripwire with a grenade bouquet. Thankfully, my training paid off, and I spotted them before any damage was done. The top was a grim sight with just a pile of bloody remains and not much loot.

Spent the rest of the day at the Corvega Assembly Plant, and it was an ordeal. The place was crawling with raiders. They had snipers on high ground, assault rifles on the low, and melee attackers on my level. Despite their numbers and decent fortification, these raiders were no match for actual tactical thinking—they were poorly armored and dumb as rocks.

The battle felt endless, a relentless barrage of fire that could’ve taken down a green power armor patrol. My pre-war combat experience really kicked in today. I dug in, created a small fortified position, and weathered the storm of bullets and explosions. It was hours of being pinned down, but slowly, I thinned their ranks, moved up, and cleared out the snipers who couldn’t handle close combat.

Inside the factory, it got dicey again. Close quarters is more my style, but even so, I took a couple of hits and burned through several stimpacks. Found the raider leader, Jared, holed up near the top, guarded by machine gun turrets and spotlights. After a grueling fight, I accessed Jared's terminal and learned a lot about their operations and his obsession with gaining prophetic powers from chems, clearly driven by some twisted past and a desperate need to dominate the Commonwealth.

With the plant secured at sunset, I was ready to set up camp away from the madness but picked up a distress signal on the radio. Decided to follow it instead of resting.

On my way, I encountered a peculiar woman dressed in pre-war clothes, rambling about bus speeds—radiation does strange things to folks. Passed a college administration building but had to keep moving due to nearby gunshots.

Found the source of the distress call—more chaos. A group was pinned down by a horde of ghouls. Jumped in to help and met the Brotherhood of Steel, with one of their guys in power armor absorbing most of the assault. Managed to help them fend off the attackers.

Exhausted and out of options, I took the Brotherhood’s offer to crash at their place for the night. Tomorrow, I’ll learn more about them, but for now, all I can think about is shutting my eyes for a few hours. This world, it’s relentless, but today, I think I made a small difference.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 11 (November 2, 2287)**

Today was more about building than battling, though the wasteland never lets you off easy. Started off back at Sanctuary, putting in the work to make it a place people can actually live in again. I set up supply lines, bolstered our defenses, and sorted out more sustainable food sources. It's starting to feel like a community, which is something I haven't felt in a long time.

After Sanctuary, I moved on to Tenpines Bluff, giving them a similar treatment. It's crucial that these settlements can stand on their own and connect with others. Building up these places isn't just about survival—it's about creating a network, making it harder for raiders or worse to wipe us out.

The day took a turn when I met Sully Mathews. Guy pretended to be friendly at first, but it didn't take long for his true colors to show. Had to take him down. It's tough, dealing with betrayal out here, makes you wonder if the old world ever really had a chance.

Next, I cleared out a place called Sunshine Tidings co-op. It was a bit of a mess, but there's a Mr. Handy there that's been reprogrammed to just chill out. Its whole vibe is about keeping things mellow, greeting everyone with a laid-back "Groovy," which was a surreal bit of humor amidst the decay.

Ended the day finding a lonely chapel. It was too late to explore it properly, so I've decided to check it out tomorrow. For now, I need some rest, to recharge after a day of building and fighting. It's nights like these, quiet except for the distant howls and wind, that you really feel the weight of the new world we're trying to forge from the scraps of the old.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 12 (November 3, 2287)**

Started my day at the lonely chapel, hoping for some quiet reflection, but instead found it overrun by a group of raiders calling themselves the Hellraiser Raiders. No peace in this world, not even in a place of worship.

After dealing with them, Preston and I made our way up a hill to the Federal Ration Stockpile. Turns out, the Hellraiser Raiders were already engaging with another raider group there. We let them thin each other out before taking a sniper position to clean up the remnants. During the skirmish, a guy in power armor nearly blindsided us. He charged up suddenly, but we kept our cool, coordinated, and managed to take him down. It was a close call, the kind that reminds you how quickly things can turn deadly out here.

Inside the stockpile, I uncovered a tangled web of raider politics. The place was run by Red Tourette, who was in a bitter feud with Tower Tom from Beantown Brewery. It seems their rivalry escalated after a failed negotiation over food supplies, leading to Tom kidnapping Red's sister Lily to ransom for supplies. Despite her efforts, including sending spies to infiltrate Tom's crew, Red never saw her sister again.

After a tough fight, I ended Red and her gang's reign at the stockpile. The constant threat of violence is draining, but these places need clearing if we're ever going to have any order.

The night brought its own terrors—an ambush in the darkness. All I saw were the muzzle flashes and the tracer rounds cutting through the black. It was disorienting, and I'm not even sure if I took them all out or if some fled.

Later, we found Bleachers Cave. Met a guy pretending to need help, but it turned out to be a trap—he was a raider trying to recruit us. Preston and I played along until they lowered their guards, then we turned the tables. It was ruthless but necessary. Trust is a rare commodity out here, and it's not freely given.

Finally, stumbled upon Relay Tower 0BB-915. It's a striking structure, a red and white radio tower, encircled by a chain link fence. Managed to use the terminal to extend its satellite dishes. It's these kinds of resources that can make a difference, maybe help us get a better handle on the area and any threats looming on the horizon.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 13 (November 4, 2287)**

This morning, we found the Fort Hagen Satellite Array, now controlled by a group known as the Rust Devils. Unlike typical raiders, these folks are tech-savvy, using customized machines and robots to bolster their raiding capabilities. Dealing with their machine gun turret at the main gate was a tough start to the day.

Next, we discovered the Boston Mayoral Shelter. The place was a grim reminder of pre-war corruption and despair. Funded by taxpayer money for the mayor's personal use, this luxurious bunker was fitted with every possible amenity while the common folk faced annihilation. After the bombs, when desperate citizens stormed the shelter seeking refuge or revenge, the mayor took his own life in a tragic attempt to protect his family—a plan that ultimately failed when the mob broke through.

While exploring the shelter, we were suddenly ambushed by synths—synthetic humans created by the Institute, known for their toughness and often mysterious motives. The encounter was fierce, and their appearance here was as puzzling as it was dangerous. Managed to avoid a Deathclaw lurking in a nearby cave by sneaking around. Those beasts are nothing but trouble.

On our journey, we passed through Forest Grove Marsh. Once a quaint suburban area, now it's a dilapidated, half-submerged ghost town, overrun with nature and feral ghouls. It's a stark example of how quickly civilization has crumbled.

Found another relay tower today and got it up and running. Extending its satellite dishes might give us a better reach and understanding of nearby signals and threats.

Our day ended at Oberland Station, a small railway checkpoint turned settlement. Despite its size, it's surprisingly well-set up for defense with its compact structure, making it ideal for fortifications. The settlers there have a humble setup with a small farm and are under constant threat from raiders and super mutants—a brutish, aggressive offshoot of humanity altered by radiation. They've asked for help dealing with some nearby super mutants, promising to align with the Minutemen if we can secure their safety. Given their strategic position and potential as a reliable ally, it seems worth the effort.

Decided to spend the night here at Oberland Station. Tomorrow, I'll deal with the super mutant threat. 

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 14 (November 5, 2287)**

Today started with a tough mission clearing out the super mutants at Fraternal Post 115. This place, a remnant from before the Great War, was meant to be a sanctuary for veterans. It's a hauntingly familiar sight with its shattered remains and poignant memories etched into every corner. We encountered the leader of the super mutants, "Dead Eye," a hulking brute. I managed to take him down before he could alert the rest, preventing a potentially overwhelming confrontation.

After wrapping up at Fraternal Post 115, we headed to the College Square station, an underground labyrinth once bustling with life, now overrun with feral ghouls and echoing with the silent screams of raiders who didn't make it out. The station, filled with traps and remnants of the old world, required careful navigation and constant vigilance as we cleared it out for the Brotherhood of Steel.

On our way through the area, we discovered Mystic Pines, a serene but eerie retirement home from before the war, now a shell of its former self. The quiet halls that once echoed with the stories of the elderly are now just a haunting backdrop for the desolation of the post-apocalypse.

Our next significant encounter was clearing the Super Duper Mart in Lexington. This location holds a tragic piece of recent history—it's where Preston Garvey and his group of survivors briefly sought refuge during their escape from the Quincy Massacre. Unfortunately, it was also where two of their members met their grisly end, overwhelmed by the feral ghouls that infest the building now. The Mart, once a place of commerce and community, now serves as a grim reminder of how quickly safety can turn to peril.

Finally, after a long and harrowing day, I made it to Diamond City. Known as the "Great Green Jewel" of the Commonwealth, it's a fortress of civilization amidst the chaos. It's late, and the neon lights flicker promisingly against the night sky. Tomorrow, I'll explore the city, but for tonight, I'm just grateful for a safe place to rest.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 15 (November 6, 2287)**

Today was a dive into the bustling heart of the Commonwealth: Diamond City. Nestled within the confines of an old baseball stadium in the Fens neighborhood of Boston, the settlement's transformation from sports venue to fortified city is nothing short of remarkable. The massive green door that serves as the main entrance sets the tone for what is arguably the safest and most prosperous place in the wasteland.

Inside, I met Mayor McDonough, caught in a heated exchange with Piper Wright, a local journalist. Piper accused him of suppressing freedom of the press, though her conspiracy theories about McDonough being a synth made it hard to gauge where the truth actually lay. Regardless, Piper pulled me aside for an interview, keen on getting my take as a newcomer, which I obliged.

Diamond City, with its robust police force, a public school, and self-sustaining agriculture, stands as a beacon of stability. The residents thrive under the protection of "the Wall," a pre-war relic that now symbolizes safety against the chaos outside. Painted green and meticulously maintained by a man named Abbot, the Wall is revered by the community. McDonough, leveraging its symbolic value, often speaks of it as the "great green guardian" that has safeguarded the city for over 150 years.

The social structure here is stark, with the wealthier citizens residing in the Upper Stands, enjoying views over the Lower Fields where the working class and less affluent live. This divide was exploited by McDonough during his anti-ghoul campaign, which led to the ghastly purge of 2282 where many ghouls were expelled, their properties seized by the human residents. This act not only solidified McDonough’s power but also calmed the poorer citizens by redistributing the confiscated wealth.

Diamond City also prides itself on offering free education to all children and hosts a non-denominational chapel that welcomes all for prayer and reflection. The city's energy needs are met by a fusion generator, an ironic nod to the nuclear technology that both doomed and now sustains human civilization.

The day was an eye-opening experience into how society can rebuild itself under the right conditions, yet it also highlighted the complexities and moral ambiguities that come with governance in a post-apocalyptic world. As night falls over Diamond City, I'm left pondering the delicate balance between security and freedom, and the lengths to which people will go to maintain the former at the expense of the latter.

Kicked off today with a showdown at Swan's Pond that I won’t soon forget. Swan isn’t just any behemoth; he's something else. Before turning into this massive beast, he was part of some messed up experiments. They turned a guy into a monster living in a pond—found this out from some old notes left around the place.

Facing Swan was like going toe-to-toe with a tank. I had my shotgun ready and a bunch of grenades. The fight was brutal. Swan’s throwing huge rocks and debris, and I’m there, dodging and chucking grenades, firing off rounds whenever I got a clear shot. Took a lot to bring him down, felt like it could go south any second. When he finally fell, it was a relief, but also kind of sad, knowing he used to be just some guy.

After dealing with Swan, I headed over to Vault 114 inside Park Street Station. This vault was supposed to be for the fancy folks, but turned out to be a real mess. They were promised luxury and got stuck living on top of each other instead. The guy in charge when the bombs fell, Soup Can Harry, was a real piece of work—no experience, just there because he didn’t like the government. They picked him on purpose to stir up trouble among the rich folks.

Inside, I found Nick Valentine, a detective, but not just any detective—he’s a synth. That was a curveball. He was locked up by Skinny Malone and his gang of Triggermen. These guys are like something out of an old mob movie, suits and all. They think they’re living out some kind of gangster fantasy, but they're just thugs.

Skinny used to know Nick from before, so instead of killing him, he kept him alive. Guess there's some honor among thieves, or at least among these Triggermen. Managed to talk our way out of a bigger fight, and got Nick out of there. 

By the time we got out of the vault, it was a load off to be back in Diamond City. Today felt like a week, what with taking down a giant and diving into some crazy vault history. Makes you think about how twisted things were even before everything went to hell. Now it's time to crash, process all this, and get ready for whatever's next.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 17 (November 8, 2287)**

This morning started with the kind of cold determination that could freeze over the entire Commonwealth. Today was all about one thing—tracking down Kellogg. This guy wasn't just any thug; he was a seasoned hunter, the kind who's left bodies and broken lives across the wasteland. Nick Valentine was with me, piecing together the last crumbs of leads we had on him.

First stop was Nick's office in Diamond City. We got to looking through old files and interviewing folks around. We got a tip that Kellogg had been seen with a kid who matched Shaun's description. More than just a lead—it was a fire lighting under me. 

We talked to Piper, hoping she might've picked up something in her news runs. Sure enough, she remembered seeing Kellogg around with a child, not just once, but a couple of times. She pointed us towards Kellogg’s last known residence in Diamond City. The place was locked up tight, his personal fortress. None of the neighbors keen to talk much about him—just gave those wary looks that said they knew more but weren't willing to share.

Breaking into Kellogg’s house needed a bit more than a bobby pin and a steady hand. Thankfully, Mayor McDonough, under some pressure and a few stern looks, reluctantly agreed to give up the key. Said it was for the "greater good of Diamond City." Inside, the place was a goldmine of clues. Cigars still fresh, some ammo scattered about, and one room almost too clean, like it was scrubbed down recently.

That’s where Dogmeat proved invaluable. Gave him a whiff of those cigars, and like a missile locked onto a target, he was off. We followed him out of the city, heading north into the wilds of the Commonwealth, the ruins becoming thicker as civilization faded into the background.

The trail was cold and hard. Dogmeat led us through old military checkpoints, raider camps picked clean, and territories that smelled of death and decay. We stumbled into a band of super mutants hunkered down in an old satellite array. Had to navigate through that mess with bullets flying. Not the kind of detour you hope for, but it was either through them or around, and around would've cost us the trail.

After what felt like miles of rough terrain, Dogmeat stopped at a small pond. There was a stash there, Kellogg's alright. More of those cigars and a bloody bandage. The scent was stronger, almost yelling at us from the ground. We weren't just on his trail now; we were on his heels.

The path took a sharp turn to Fort Hagen. As we approached, the air got thicker, the kind of quiet that screams trouble. Nick and I exchanged a look—this was it. The building loomed, dead and daunting. The security was tight, with turrets and synths guarding the perimeter. Kellogg wasn’t just hiding; he was fortified.

Inside Fort Hagen, the air was stale, the corridors a maze of pre-war bureaucracy turned death trap. Kellogg’s voice crackled over the intercom, taunting, trying to rattle me. But every word only sharpened my focus. We fought through layers of security—more synths, automated defenses, all thrown at us with cold precision.

Finally, the confrontation. Kellogg was there, just as real and dangerous as the stories made him out to be. The room was dim, lit only by the glow of old monitors and the occasional flicker of a failing light. He tried to talk, said things about the new world, about survival and destiny. But his words were just noise against the backdrop of my roaring blood.

The fight was brutal and direct. No tricks, no running. Bullets flew, cover was scarce. In the end, it was just two men with their causes, and only one walking away. As he lay there, a finality settled over the room. I searched his body, finding near nothing.

Walking out of Fort Hagen, the weight of the day was heavy. I'm no closer to Shaun, closer to ending this nightmare. The sun was setting, casting long shadows over the Commonwealth, a stark reminder that no victory here is without its darkness.

Tomorrow, I follow Nick's clues, said he might just have an idea to find Shaun. But tonight, I rest, and I remember why I fight. It’s for Shaun, for Nora, for the chance to set things right in this twisted new world.
