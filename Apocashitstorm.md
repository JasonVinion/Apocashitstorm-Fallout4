**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 0 (October 23, 2077)**

What a day, what a horrible day. Morning was normal, just me, Nora, Shaun, and Codsworth hanging around. Then everything went to hell. Cosworth yells out about bombs hitting New York and Washington. Damn lucky that Vault-Tec guy came earlier, got us a spot in Vault 111 because of my army days and Nora being a lawyer.

When the alarm hit, we bolted. Had to leave Codsworth, though. The vault folks rushed us into these pods, saying they were for decontamination, but no, they were freezing us! I couldn’t do anything when they shot Nora and took Shaun. Then everything went black.

Woke up later, found out it was all some sick experiment. The vault’s a mess, everyone’s gone or dead. Had to fight off these giant roaches with just a baton. Must’ve killed a bunch of them before I found the exit.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 1 (October 23, 2287)**

Out of the vault, and the world’s gone gray and dead. Felt like something was off, so I took a detour, then heard some folks. Tried to be friendly, but they shot at me. Had to take them down, their dog too. Felt awful, like, were these my neighbors?

Looted their camp for whatever could help, found some crummy armor. Got jumped again, but handled it. Then back home, and there’s Codsworth, acting like it’s just another day. He tells me it’s been 210 years. Can you believe that?

We checked out the old neighborhood, fighting bugs and taking what we could. Left with Codsworth, but then met this dog at a gas station. Named him Dogmeat. He’s a good boy. We’re sticking together.

Night’s coming, so we’re heading to Concord under the cover of dark. Can’t believe this is my life now.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 2 (October 24, 2287)**

The night was a hell of a lot more eventful than I hoped. Staying in the Red Rocket station where I met Dogmeat turned into a battlefield. Got jumped by massive mole rats and some of the biggest rats I’ve ever seen. Managed to beat down the mole rats with my trusty baton from the vault, but those rats forced me to waste some precious ammo.

Heading into Concord this morning, Dogmeat and I kept it quiet, even managed to sneak past a raider scout armed with just a pool cue. Then heard this massive firefight happening not too far off. Someone was yelling for help. My old instincts took over, and I ran towards the chaos.

Found a guy on a balcony, holding off raiders with a laser weapon like I’ve never seen. Looked like a cross between a musket and a high-tech science project. He was in a bad spot, with about five or six raiders trying to storm his position. With him firing from above and me coming in from behind, we caught the raiders off guard and took them out fast. The guy then tossed me a laser musket like his and told me he was trapped with a few others. Needed my help, so I charged in.

The place was a mess, looked like some old museum. There was this Advanced-locked gate and a big mural, and a crashed Vertibird was hanging through the roof. Inside, two raiders were shooting down at me from a balcony, but they couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn, made it easy to take them out with my training.

Sneaking through the museum, I found a fusion core behind an easy-to-pick lock. Still had some juice in it—might fetch some caps later. Looted what I could—ammo, scrap, the usual survival stuff.

Finally found the room where the others were holed up. The group was a mixed bag. Preston Garvey, the guy from the balcony, was their leader, a real straight shooter. Then there was Mama Murphy, an old lady with more spirit than most and some sort of sight into the future—sounds crazy, but these days, who knows? There were a few more: Sturges, a handy guy with tools; Marcy and Jun Long, a couple still shaken by everything that’s happened.

We decided to hunker down in the museum for the night. Made camp amid the relics of the old world, trying to make sense of this new one. Tomorrow, we'll see about moving out. But for tonight, at least, we’ve got a roof and walls.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 3 (October 25, 2287)**

Started the day with a quick lesson from Sturges on picking advanced locks and patching up weapons—skills that'll sure come in handy. But before I could put that new know-how to real use, the raiders decided they weren’t done with us. Bullets started punching through the walls again.

We had one shot to push back, thanks to the vertibird crash on the roof. The old T-45 power armor up there and a minigun still attached needed a fusion core—which I had from yesterday. Suited up, feeling the weight and power of that armor, I ripped the minigun off and got ready to rain hell.

While up there, I found a holotape in a toolbox. It was from Staff Sergeant Michael Daly, a guy I knew briefly from my service days. Daly's log was grim: his vertibird went down on the day the bombs fell, crew casualties followed, and the surviving members either got shot by panicking survivors or abandoned the site. His armor ran out of juice, and with no reason to stick around, he decided to check on his sister in Boston, questioning if "AWOL" even meant anything anymore. That gave me a pause—how many more were out there, wandering alone?

Anyway, decked out in Daly's armor, I laid into the raiders. But as I was collecting ammo off the dead, this monster—like some sort of demon lizard on two legs—burst from the ground. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen, tearing through what was left of the raiders. I unloaded the minigun into it until I had to duck into a building, while it took off in the other direction. Can't say if it died, but it sure wasn’t sticking around to chat.

Low on ammo and with the power armor's core nearly spent, I had to ditch the heavy gear. Gathered what I could from the raider corpses, snagged a sawed-off shotgun among the loot. Met back up with the gang, and we decided it was time to move. We’re heading to Sanctuary, where I used to live. Hopefully, we can set up something stable there. It’s been one hell of a day, but at least we’re still breathing.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 4 (October 26, 2287)**

Today was heavy, found an old tape in a run-down cabin, belonged to a girl who ran away the night before the bombs fell. Told her folks she was pregnant, they freaked out—her dad yelling, her mom just crying. She couldn't turn to the baby's father, just took refuge in that old cabin. Found a skeleton next to it, probably hers. Sad to think she might have come here for shelter only to meet the end.

Then there's Preston, saying we need to rebuild, get the Minutemen back on their feet. Wants me to help people out here; couldn't say no. But damn, down to 29 bullets in my 10mm, and after today, I'm worrying how long I can keep this up.

Stumbled upon Abernathy farm, a place literally built around a radio tower. Met Blake Abernathy, said raiders killed one of his daughters, Mary, and took her locket. His family, including his wife Connie, grows mostly tatos. They've got a cat named Maisie and a two-headed cow, or Brahmin as they call it, named Clarabell. This farm is like a slice of old-world normal in the middle of chaos.

Saw my first Radstag too, or so I think there called, it's like a deer but a nastier, two-headed version. Found a Minuteman stash but no luck opening it. Then there was this old house, a skeleton in the bathtub—creepy spot with drugs scattered everywhere. 

Got ambushed in the forest outside of Sanctuary. Thankfully, a scavenger distracted them long enough for me to take cover and handle the situation. Decided I need both Dogmeat and Codsworth with me. I don't like traveling in a pack of three, especially not with one being a robot. Were very loud and its hard to hide, but I need Cosworth to watch me and dogmeat's back. 

These raiders are relentless. Blake thinks they're holed up at USAF base Olivia. Preston hears of another group terrorizing a settlement. I'm caught between needing to fight and wanting to avoid it. But if I'm to listen to Preston and head to this so called 'Diamond City' to chase leads that he thinks will help me find Shaun, I can’t have raiders on my trail.

Thinking of hitting the USAF base first. It’s a military setup, so I should be familiar with the layout. They're targeting small outfits like Abernathy’s, so maybe they're not as strong as they seem. I need to gear up, though. Despite being ready physically, mentally, it's a whole other story. War was supposed to be behind me, not part of rebuilding a life.

Tomorrow’s about prepping. If I can quiet down these raider threats, maybe, just maybe, I can make it to Diamond City without another target on my back. But, damn, this isn’t the life I signed up for—not again.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 5 (October 27, 2287)**

Morning found me poking around the Wicked Shipping Fleet Lockup. It’s eerie how quickly places fall apart these days. Stumbled upon a bunch of corpses—only these weren't your usual dead. Codsworth calls them Feral Ghouls; pretty much zombies if you ask me. Had a close call with one that latched onto my leg, but I put it down fast. Managed to get a Protectron functioning and set it to handle the ghouls while I explored.

Found a holotape left behind by someone named Tim Flynn, warning his brother Blake about a shady deal gone sour with a guy named Eddie. Talk about family drama turning potentially lethal. He was desperate to shut down their business and skip town, scared of the consequences.

Heading back to Concord, I got ambushed by a group shouting "for the gunners," which I guess is their gang name. They were tough, well-armed, and trained, but not smart enough to avoid a choke point. Codsworth torched them with his flamethrower while I used the cabin for cover. Looted a full set of Combat armor off them; felt familiar and reassuring, like slipping into an old habit.

Inside the cabin, I found a root cellar turned into a sort of makeshift bunker with supplies and a weapon workbench. The real surprise was the ghoul inside—turned out to be Wayne Gorski, a radical libertarian who thought the government was out to control minds with new electrical pylons. Found his terminal detailing plans to blow up the "mind control device" with a homemade bomb from mini nuke parts and nuclear waste. Talk about going out with a bang. Thankfully, his plan never took off—world ended before his did.

Decided to spend the night in that cabin. It’s quiet, and after today, quiet’s good. Seems every corner of this wasteland hides someone’s broken dream or a nightmare waiting to jump out. But this armor feels right, gives me a bit of the old days back. Tomorrow's another day to push forward, hopefully with a little less unexpected company.

**Apocashitstorm Tour, day 6 (October 28, 2287)**

Today, I headed back to Concord to cover some ground I missed earlier. It started off grim enough with a fire still burning and two dead bodies next to it. No time to ponder that scene, as I heard noise from a nearby house on the ridge. Suddenly, these robot-like creatures, a blend of machine and something eerily human, came storming out. They were armed with these weird, modified blue laser pistols.

Taking cover, I opened fire. These things, synths they're called, soaked up bullets like sponges. It took a ridiculous amount of lead to bring them down—arms, then legs, and finally a shot to the head did it. Found something called a 'synth component' inside their skulls, which is where I got there name from. Each ship came with with a serial number, wonder how many of these things there are. Those things pack a punch; was lucky to have a stimpack to patch myself up.

Inside the house, I found a dead junkie, looked like he tried to fight but didn’t stand much chance. Took the chems off him and moved on. Found a letter nearby titled 'The Day the Bombs Fell'—a suicide note from Concord's mayor talking about his family. This world’s just full of sad stories.

Next was the Concord speakeasy. The place was a mess, full of overdose victims and scattered chems like X-cell and Day Tripper. There was this one room with a skeleton in a bathtub, surrounded by mannequins posed with machetes and a plunger. Creepy doesn’t even start to cover it. Rushed out of there when I encountered two feral ghoul kids. Broke my heart, but had to put them down.

Made my way to the Concord Workhouse after that. Mostly empty, but found a skeleton clutching a duffle bag on the third floor, a baby rattle lying next to it—a small, haunting reminder of normal life. Just as I was about to leave, a group of Gunners barged in. Big shootout ensued. They had numbers, but I had the high ground. Nearly took a bullet to the head, but my combat armor's helmet saved me. Managed to escape without a scratch.

Concord’s giving me more than I bargained for—ghosts of the past and very real dangers of the present. Keeps you on your toes, this place. But with each day, each fight, I'm finding bits and pieces of what it takes to survive here. Just got to keep moving, stay sharp.
