# Apocashitstorm Project

## Overview

**Apocashitstorm** is an immersive narrative project where the thrilling events of Fallout 4 VR are retold through the eyes of a custom character. Every day, these events are described to a customized GPT model which then crafts daily diary entries, capturing the essence of the post-apocalyptic journey.

This repository serves as a chronicle of this character's experiences, interpreted by the AI and illustrated through sketches that depict key moments and emotions of the narrative.

### Why Obsidian?
This project is intended to be viewed in [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/) for an enhanced reading experience. Obsidian allows for integrated viewing of markdown files and linked media, providing a seamless narrative experience that traditional markdown viewers can't offer.

## Contents

- **Daily Diary Entries:** Each day of gameplay is turned into a detailed diary entry, marking the progress and events encountered by the character.
- **Illustrations:** Accompanying the diary entries are AI illustrations of a hand-drawn style, that are based around the events in the diary entires, depicting scenes, characters, and moments from the journey.
- **Metadata:** For those who are curious about the behind-the-scenes, metadata files track the creation and revision history of the diary entries and illustrations.
