# Apocashitstorm Project

## Overview

**Apocashitstorm** is an immersive narrative project where the thrilling events of Fallout 4 VR are retold through the eyes of a custom character. Every day, these events are described to a customized GPT model which then crafts daily diary entries, capturing the essence of the post-apocalyptic journey.

This repository serves as a chronicle of this character's experiences, interpreted by the AI and illustrated through sketches that depict key moments and emotions of the narrative.

### Why Obsidian?
This project is intended to be viewed in [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/) for an enhanced reading experience. Obsidian allows for integrated viewing of markdown files and linked media, providing a seamless narrative experience that traditional markdown viewers can't offer.

## Contents

- **Daily Diary Entries:** Each day of gameplay is turned into a detailed diary entry, marking the progress and events encountered by the character.
- **Illustrations:** Accompanying the diary entries are AI illustrations of a hand-drawn style, that are based around the events in the diary entires, depicting scenes, characters, and moments from the journey.
- **Metadata:** For those who are curious about the behind-the-scenes, metadata files track the creation and revision history of the diary entries and illustrations.

## Rules & Challenges

Welcome to a more relentless and immersive experience in survival mode. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

### Rules
- **Survival Mode**: The game must be exclusively played in Survival Mode to ensure that all challenges are impactful and the gameplay remains intense.

### Challenges

1. **Smart AI**
   - Full overhaul of AI: Opponents now employ real tactics, travel in packs, and have enhanced accuracy, making them much more formidable.

2. **Radiation Overhaul**
   - Enhanced radiation zones: Radiation is now present in 4x more locations throughout the Commonwealth.
   - Increased radiation damage: Radiation effects are quadrupled, meaning 1 rad in the normal game is equivalent to 4 rads now.

3. **Realistic Loot**
   - Scarce resources: Ammunition and essential supplies are significantly harder to find.
   - Most found items are now considered worthless junk, adding to the challenge of scavenging.

4. **Health and Damage Overhaul**
   - Realistic combat dynamics: Bullets are deadly; receiving two bullets to the chest can be fatal, which applies to both the player and NPCs.
   - Bullets are now physical objects, bullet drop, accuracy, kickback, and more! No more hitscan or point-and-click firefights. 

5. **Enhanced Danger**
   - Persistent threats: Stalkers will periodically hunt you down, especially in areas you frequently visit, adding a continuous layer of threat to your survival efforts.

6. **Ghoul Overhaul**
   - Increased ghoul presence: There are significantly more ghouls, enhancing the sense of danger and unpredictability.
   - Improved ghoul AI: Ghouls now exhibit smarter behavior, waiting to ambush players, leading to more jump scares.
   - Reskinned enemies: Ghouls and other enemies have been reskinned to appear much scarier, enhancing the horror element of the game.

7. **Total Stealth Overhaul**
   - Enhanced realism in stealth: Stealth mechanics have been overhauled to be more realistic. Using flashlights, having a robot companion, or firing a gun makes you much more noticeable.
   - Persistent enemy engagement: Enemies no longer disengage or fall back to their original positions but continue to track and pursue the player relentlessly.

8. **Sprinting and Explosives Adjustment**
   - Modified sprinting: Sprinting is now faster, but players can sprint for much shorter durations, demanding better stamina management.
   - Enhanced lethality of explosives: Molotovs, fire, and other explosives have a much larger range and are deadlier, requiring careful handling and strategic use.

Prepare yourself for an unforgiving journey through the Commonwealth, where every decision counts and survival is a constant battle.
